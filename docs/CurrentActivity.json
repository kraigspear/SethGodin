            "content" : "<p><em>This might not work.</em></p>\r\n<p>I didn&#39;t realize how tired I was until I started driving away from the Icarus launch event on Wednesday.</p>\r\n<p>Since June, I&#39;ve been working flat out on creating the four books that were part of the Kickstarter and the big launch that climaxed with an event here in New York. Along the way, I experienced what many people feel as they work on something new--I was &#0160;spending part of my time (against my better judgment) exhausting myself trying to predict and then control what people would think about my work.</p>\r\n<p>Will they get it? Will this chapter hit home? Am I too far out on a limb?</p>\r\n<p><em>This might not work.</em></p>\r\n<p>At some level, &quot;this might not work&quot; is at the heart of all important projects, of everything new and worth doing. And it can paralyze us into inaction, into watering down our art and into failing to ship.</p>\r\n<p>I do my best work when I practice what I write about, and this time, I decided it was important to go as far out on a limb as I could. <em>The Icarus Deception</em> argues that we&#39;re playing it too safe, hence my need to go outside my (and your) comfort zone.</p>\r\n<p>Changing the format, changing the way I interacted with some of my readers (using Kickstarter) and changing the timeframe of my work all combined to make this project the most complex one I&#39;ve ever done. Lots of moving parts, of course, but more scary, lots of places to fail. All very self-referential in a series of books about failure and guts and flying closer to the sun, of course. That&#39;s the entire point, right?</p>\r\n<p>Of course, trying to control what other people think is a trap. At the same time that we can be thrilled by the possibility of flying without a net and of blazing a new trail, we have to avoid the temptation to become the audience, to will them into following us. Not only is it exhausting, it&#39;s counterproductive. Sales (of concepts, of services, of goods) don&#39;t get made because you&#39;ve spent a sleepless night working on your telekenisis. They happen because you&#39;ve made something worth buying, because you&#39;ve outlined something worth believing in.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;This might not work&quot; is either a curse, something that you labor under, or it&#39;s a blessing, a chance to fly and do work you never thought possible.</p>\r\n<p>As I slumped into my car, I turned on the radio. Stuck in the CD player, forgotten in the rush to get to the event, was the audio copy of Icarus.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"asset  asset-audio at-xid-6a00d83451b31569e2017c35500457970b\">(<a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/files/excerpt-for-blog.mp3\">Download Audio Excerpt</a>)</p>\r\nI don&#39;t usually listen to my books after I&#39;ve made them, but the recording sessions had been so arduous that I didn&#39;t even remember making the recording. So there it was in my car, left behind as a quick refresher before I went onstage to give my first public talk about the book.&#0160;\r\n<p>It turns out that I don&#39;t just write for you. I also write to remind myself of what I&#39;m hoping to become as well. Hearing myself, months later, reading something I didn&#39;t remember writing or reading, I shed a few tears. Yes, this is work worth doing. Yes, being out on a limb is exactly where I want to be.</p>\r\n<p>That&#39;s where we&#39;re needed... out on a limb.</p>",

There are more than 360 communities signed up so far, with thousands of people around the world getting together in small groups to speak up and to support each other.</p>\r\n<p>Two things might hold someone back from sharing the art they&#39;ve got inside: The fear of telling the truth or the lame strategy of hiding the truth behind a sales pitch.&#0160;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you can, find a way to come to a session near you tonight. And if you can find the voice, stand up and tell people what you care about.</p>\r\n<p>Your art is vitally important, and what makes it art is that it is personal, important and fraught with the whiff of failure. This is precisely why it&#39;s scarce and thus valuableÃ¢ÂÂit&#39;s difficult to stand up and own it and say, &quot;here, I made this.&quot; For me, anyway, writing a book is far easier than handing it to someone I care about and asking them to read it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017ee6d54699970d-popup\" onclick=\"window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false\" style=\"float: right;\"><img alt=\"NewsethBN\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b31569e2017ee6d54699970d\" src=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017ee6d54699970d-120wi\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;\" title=\"NewsethBN\" /></a>Throughout the USA, there are bookstores (<a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/whatcha-gonna-do-with-that-duck?keyword=seth+godin&amp;store=allproducts\" target=\"_self\">Barnes and Noble</a> as a notable example) hosting piles of my new book, <em><a href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/theicarusdeception\" target=\"_self\">The Icarus Deception</a></em>. </p>\r\n<p>Here&#39;s something you might do today: Go to this <a href=\"https://seth-godin.squarespace.com/\" target=\"_self\">site</a>, scroll down and find the laid-out <a href=\"https://seth-godin.squarespace.com/blog/567pgcrktbd9l3etxvb41uyegu37wa\" target=\"_self\">bookmark</a> and print it out. Take the bookmark and write on it. Write down your project, your feelings, the thing you&#39;re making--share your art. Tell us your URL if you have one, or draw a picture if you like. And then go to the local bookstore and carefully put the bookmark in a copy of <em>Icarus</em>.

But enough of them were that he left his mark.</p>\r\n<p>You can find my <a href=\"http://www.squidoo.com/whatch-gonna-do-with-that-duck\" target=\"_self\">most popular posts of the year right here</a>. My new collection, <em>Whatcha Gonna Do With That Duck</em> is now available at finer bookstores online and off. I could never, ever have signed up to write this book, never sat down to create it. But since I had six years to write it, it created itself.</p>\r\n<p><em>You don&#39;t launch a popular blog, you build one.</em></p>\r\n<p>The writing isn&#39;t the hard part, it&#39;s the commitment.

As you plan the magical things you will do next year, I thought it was worth reconsidering:]</p>\r\n<p>The thing is, it&#39;s far easier than ever before to surface your ideas. Far easier to have someone notice your art or your writing or your photography. Which means that people who might have hidden their talents are now finding them noticed...</p>\r\n<p>That blog you&#39;ve built, the one with a lot of traffic... perhaps it can&#39;t be monetized.</p>\r\n<p>That non-profit you work with, the one where you are able to change lives... perhaps turning it into a career will ruin it.</p>\r\n<p>That passion you have for graphic art... perhaps making your painting commercial enough to sell will squeeze the joy out of it.</p>\r\n<p>When what you do is what you love, you&#39;re able to invest more effort and care and time. That means you&#39;re more likely to win, to gain share, to profit. On the other hand, poets don&#39;t get paid. Even worse, poets that try to get paid end up writing jingles and failing and hating it at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>Today, there are more ways than ever to share your talents and hobbies in public. And if you&#39;re driven, talented and focused, you may discover that the market loves what you do. That people read your blog or click on your cartoons or listen to your mp3s. But, alas, that doesn&#39;t mean you can monetize it, quit your day job and spend all day writing songs.</p>\r\n<p>The pitfalls:<br />1. In order to monetize your work, you&#39;ll probably corrupt it, taking out the magic in search of dollars<br />and<br />2. Attention doesn&#39;t always equal significant cash flow.</p>\r\n<p>I think it makes sense to make your art your art, to give yourself over to it without regard for commerce.</p>\r\n<p>Doing what you love is as important as ever, but if you&#39;re going to make a living at it, it helps to find a niche where money flows as a regular consequence of the success of your idea. Loving what you do is almost as important as doing what you love, especially if you need to make a living at it. Go find a job you can commit to, a career or a business you can fall in love with.</p>\r\n<p>A friend who loved music, who wanted to spend his life doing it, got a job doing PR for a record label. He hated doing PR, realized that just because he was in the record business didn&#39;t mean he had anything at all to do with music. Instead of finding a job he could love, he ended up being in proximity to, but nowhere involved with, something he cared about. I wish he had become a committed school teacher instead, spending every minute of his spare time making music and sharing it online for free. Instead, he&#39;s a frazzled publicity hound working twice as many hours for less money and doing no music at all.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe you can&#39;t make money doing what you love (at least what you love right now). But I bet you can figure out how to love what you do to make money (if you choose wisely).</p>\r\n<p>Do your art. But don&#39;t wreck your art if it doesn&#39;t lend itself to paying the bills. That would be a tragedy.</p>\r\n<p>(And the twist, because there is always a twist, is that as soon as you focus on your art and leave the money behind, you may just discover that this focus turns out to be the secret of actually breaking through and making money.)</p>\r\n<p>And from a <a href=\"http://writetodone.com/2012/12/20/seth-godin-part-2/\" target=\"_self\">recent interview</a>:</p>\r\n<p><strong>I wonder why anyone would hesitate to be generous with their writing.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I mean, if you really want to make a living, go to Wall Street and trade oil futures ... WeÃ¢ÂÂre writers. WeÃ¢ÂÂre doing something that is inherently a generous act. WeÃ¢ÂÂre exposing ourselves to the muse and to the things that frighten us. Why do that if youÃ¢ÂÂre not willing to be generous? And paradoxically, almost ironically, it turns out that the more generous you are, the more money you make. But thatÃ¢ÂÂs secondary. For me, the privilege of being generous is why I get to do this.</p>",

He saw images and stories that were available to anyone who chose to see them, but others averted their eyes, grabbed for the easy or the quick or the work that would satisfy the boss in closest proximity.</p>\r\n<p>When everyone has the same Mac and the same internet, the difference between hackneyed graphic design and extraordinary graphic design is just one thingÃ¢ÂÂthe ability to see.</p>\r\n<p>Seeing, despite the name, isn&#39;t merely visual. I worked briefly with Arthur C. Clarke thirty years ago, and he saw, but he saw in words, and in concepts. The people who built the internet, the one you&#39;re using right now, saw how circuits and simple computer code could be connected to build something new and bigger. Others had the same tools, but not the same vision.</p>\r\n<p>And all around us, we&#39;re surrounded by limits, by disasters (natural and otherwise) and by pessimism. Some people see in this opportunity and a chance to draw (with any sort of metaphorical pen) something. Others see in it a chance to hide, to settle and to sigh.</p>\r\n<p>The same confidence and hubris that Kubrick and Clarke brought to their movie is available to anyone who decides to give more than they &#39;should&#39; to a <a href=\"https://www.charitywater.org/donate/#step-1\" target=\"_self\">charity</a> that has the <a href=\"http://www.acumenfund.org\" target=\"_self\">audacity</a> to <a href=\"http://www.buildon.org/\" target=\"_self\">change</a> things. While others believe they can (and must) merely settle.</p>\r\n<p>In our best possible future together, I hope we&#39;ll do a better job of learning to see one another.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Some people see a struggling person and turn away. Others see a human being and work to open a door or lend a hand. There are possiblities all around us. Not just the clicks of recycling a tired cliche, but the opportunity to be brave. If we only had the guts.</p>",

(PS all of this works for apps, too). Most people who are responsible for websites are amateurs. This is my best take on how the goal-oriented non-professional can do a good job.</p>\r\n<p>Three things worth remembering:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Every website is a marketing effort. Sooner or later, your site involves an interaction with a user, and that interaction won't be 100% technical. You have to sell the engagement, the interaction and the story you have in mind. While websites have always involved technology, the tech is secondary to your ability to get your point across.</li>\r\n<li>Virtually all websites are not on the cutting edge of technology. You're doing something that's been done before, at least technically.</li>\r\n<li>Synchronizing your team is difficult, because most people know it when they see it, and seeing it is expensive. It's sort of like building a hundred houses in order to find the one that your spouse likes--not a practical effort.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The approach I recommend: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Find the tech elements you need by browsing the web. Make a list--I want menus that work like this site, a shopping cart that works like that site, a home page that works like this one.</li>\r\n<li>Create the entire site (or at least the critical elements) using Keynote on the Mac (PowerPoint works too, but Keynote is a little easier to work with). Begin by copying and pasting elements from other sites, but as you make progress, hire a graphic designer to create the elements you need. Keynote makes it easy to actually have spots on the screen link to other slides in the 'presentation', so the document you create will actually allow your team to click on various parts of the screen and jump to other pages.</li>\r\n<li>Do not do any coding at all.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>What you end up with, then, is a 3 or 10 or 100 page Keynote document, with a look and a feel. With menus. With fonts. With things in their proper hierarchy. Once you're good at this, you can build or tweak a 'site' in no time.</p>\r\n<p>Now you have a powerful tool. You can use it in presentations, in meetings and even test it with users, all before you do any coding at all. Once you've shared this with the team, the question is simple, \"if our website works just like this, do you approve of it?\" Don't start coding until the answer is yes.</p>\r\n<p>This is a discipline, one that takes a fair amount of guts to stick with, but it pays off huge dividends. Don't code until you know what you want.</p>\r\n<p>Last step: Hand the Keynote doc to your developers and go away until it's finished.</p>\r\n<p>As I said, this works for mobile apps too. Here's a <a href=\"http://keynotopia.com/\" target=\"_self\">site</a> filled with template shortcuts for both.</p>",

(Another example: The team that typesets traditional books at most publishers is talented and driven. They do it with care and very high standards, and have for nearly a hundred years. The team that typesets ebooks at most publishers, though, is more junior, understaffed and has a very low bar for what is considered good enough.)</p>\r\n<p>One reason that incumbents are so often defeated by newcomers is that the incumbents put their best people and their urgent focus on the stuff they used to do (like winning Pulitzer prizes, selling ads to cosmetic companies and counting dead trees) while the new guys have nothing but the new thing to focus on.</p>\r\n<p>The same effect occurs when we approach our art/sideline/new venture. Some people spend their best energy on the new project, squeezing in the day job when they must. Others (the ones who rarely ship) insist on every element of the day job being finished before they practice their music, write their book or otherwise make a ruckus.</p>\r\n<p>If you&#39;re serious about building a new sort of asset, or experiencing the cutting edge of new technology, or rebuilding the way you grow, the first way to demonstrate that seriousness is to put your heavy hitters in charge of it, while refusing to pay much attention at all to the people or the metrics of the old thing. Easier to say than to do, but consider how the upstarts that are eating your future are allocating <em>their</em> time and their talent...</p>",

Some of the students are using cell phones to update Facebook or tweet--and they are sitting right next to students listening intently and not merely taking notes. This juxtaposition puts a very sharp point on an overlooked distinction: some forms of media we engage with because there&#39;s a significant utility, and sometimes, we&#39;re merely entertaining ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Every student in the lecture makes a choice in each moment--to be entertained and be in sync with the crowd online, or to find utility, by doing the more difficult work of focusing on something that only pays off in the long run.</p>\r\n<p>And if that was the end of it, caveat emptor. But it&#39;s not, because media consumed doesn&#39;t merely have an impact on the consumer.</p>\r\n<p>Media, of course, has morphed and expanded, and the change is accelerating. It has grown in both time spent and impact on us. Now, media consumption changes just about everything in our lives, all day long. While a century ago, a few minutes a day might have been spent with a newspaper or reading a letter, today, it&#39;s not unusual for every minute of the day to involve consuming or creating media (or dealing with the repercussions of that). Media doesn&#39;t just change what we focus on, it changes the culture it is part of.</p>\r\n<p>I think we can agree that sending animated gifs or wasting an hour with the Jersey Shore have no utility, really, other than as a pastime. Court TV didn&#39;t make us smarter, it just wasted our time and attention. At the other extreme is learning a difficult new skill or attending an essential meeting, bringing full attention to something that doesn&#39;t always delight or tantalize. Or consider the difference between viewing politics as a sporting event with winners and losers each day, compared with the difficult work of digging in and actually understanding (and participating in) what&#39;s being discussed...</p>\r\n<p>The blended situations, though, are worth sorting out. Is watching the news an activity that has utility? Perhaps it does for a headline, but is an endless, shallow, pundit-filled examination of politics or disasters actually producing value? When we involve desperate strangers in reality TV shows (planned or not), where is the utility? Does it make us better?</p>\r\n<p>The media-industrial complex, of course, wants to turn everything into a profitable show. Is that what&#0160;<em>we</em> want?&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>More media is not better media.</p>\r\n<p>Fast media is not improved media.</p>\r\n<p>Pack media is not the media we need.</p>\r\n<p>Entertaining media is not the only option.</p>",

Merely pushing an idea via relentless ad spend is no longer sufficient. The alternative: remarkable products and services, where &#39;remarkable&#39; means something that someone is making a remark about.\r\n<p>When someone remarks on what you&#39;re doing, the word spreads, replacing the predictable and expensive Mad-Men strategy of advertising with the unpredictable but potentially magical effect of significant word of mouth--ideas that spread win.</p>\r\n<p>But what makes something remarkable?</p>\r\n<p>Last month, I self-published an 800-page, 19-pound book, a book big enough to kill a small mammal if misused. It&#39;s not for sale, but those that received a copy via <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/06/reflections-on-todays-kickstarter.html\" target=\"_self\">Kickstarter</a> have <a href=\"http://sashadichter.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/gifts-the-icarus-deception/\" target=\"_self\">posted</a> about it, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10200284342256779.2197016.1400229617&amp;type=1\" target=\"_self\">talked</a> about it and even made <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/297519465/the-icarus-deception-why-make-art-new-from-seth-go/posts/359476\" target=\"_self\">videos</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The nicest thing anyone told me was that it was, &quot;ridiculous.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Of course it was. It weighs too much, it cost me too much to ship it to the recipients. It&#39;s too big to bring to the beach and will probably disintegrate under its own weight over time.</p>\r\n<p>It&#39;s ridiculous to not sell a book this cool at retail after you&#39;ve gone to the trouble of making it, and ridiculous to spend that much time making something at a loss.</p>\r\n<p>It turns out that most of what we choose to talk about today is ridiculous. The dramatically overproduced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DMekJ24GNCE\" target=\"_self\">music</a>&#0160;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0\" target=\"_self\">video</a>. &#0160;The business model that is so <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/KellerWilliams\" target=\"_self\">generous</a>&#0160;that we can&#39;t imagine it succeeding. The <a href=\"http://abbeyryan.com/Private-Instruction.html\" target=\"_self\">painter</a> who produces a new painting every single day.</p>\r\n<p>Hugh&#39;s&#0160;<a href=\"http://www.gapingvoidart.com/about-gapingvoid\" target=\"_self\">cartoons</a>&#0160;are ridiculous, of course, as is his promiscuous non-business business model.</p>\r\n<p>The audacity of caring too much, sharing too much and connecting too much.</p>\r\n<p>If it&#39;s <em>not</em> ridiculous, it&#39;s hard to imagine it resonating with the people who will invest time and energy to spread the word. The magic irony is that the ridiculous plan is actually the most sensible...</p>\r\n<p>We can view the term <em>ridiculous</em> as an insult from the keeper of normal, a put-down from the person who seeks to maintain the status quo and avoid even the contemplation of failure.</p>\r\n<p>Or we embrace ridiculous as the sign that maybe, just maybe, we&#39;re being generous, daring, creative and silly. You know, remarkable.</p>\r\n<p>Two more thoughts on this:</p>\r\n<p>Ridiculous isn&#39;t safe. If you do something ridiculous and you fail, people get to say, &quot;you idiot, of course you failed, what you were doing was ridiculous.&quot; Which is precisely why it&#39;s so rare. Not because we are unable to imagine being ridiculous, but because we&#39;re afraid to be.</p>\r\n<p>And second...</p>\r\n<p>Don&#39;t be ridiculous because it&#39;s a clever marketing strategy. No, be ridiculous because while the effectiveness allows you to be, the real intent is to be generous or thrilling or to touch some stars. <em>Because you can.</em></p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017ee63f1641970d-popup\" onclick=\"window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Ridiculous-new-remarkablev5\" border=\"0\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b31569e2017ee63f1641970d image-full\" src=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017ee63f1641970d-800wi\" title=\"Ridiculous-new-remarkablev5\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>&#0160;</p>",

Not for nothing did Toy Story 3 sell more tickets in the first 48 hours than just about any other movie did over its entire run... that&#39;s the result of expectation, distribution and marketing, not just in being good.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stevenpressfield.com/2012/12/the-story-behind-the-random-house-gives-5000-bonuses-story/\" target=\"_self\">Shawn Coyne</a> shows us how some of this math works in book publishing. Having the biggest book of the year translated into enough profits for Random House to not only pay for bonuses for everyone, but to bank millions more. We can all agree (I hope) that <em>50 Shades</em> isn&#39;t the best book published this decade, but it&#39;s certainly one of the biggest.</p>\r\n<p>The question (sorry it took so long to get here) is this: how much should the author have invested in creating an environment where this was more likely to happen? Shawn argues that she gave up a fortune by selling the ebook rights cheap in order to get a big bookstore push. Which is true. But, and it&#39;s a huge but, did the imprimatur of a huge publishing house help her avoid the chasm of being merely popular? Did the bookstore distribution and hype and media attention provide the magic that made her book tip?</p>\r\n<p>Every industry is filled with agents, marketers, promoters, retailers and associations that promise just that--the little bit of magic, the last bit of straw, the finger on the scale that will turn a good product into the biggest hit ever. That celebrity endorsement or joint marketing venture might just work... This scaffolding is expensive, but worth every penny when it works.&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Here&#39;s the error and the challenge:</p>\r\n<p>The error is in thinking that once you figure out how to pay for the scaffolding, you&#39;re sure to cross the chasm to hitsville. This is easily disproven by glancing at just how many non-wins were published by Random House, represented by CAA or given shelf space at Walmart. There may be some causation, but there&#39;s also a lot of credit-grabbing correlation going on as well. (And yes, credit to publishers who take chances and pay money and support authors when they need it most...)</p>\r\n<p>The challenge is in investing enough in the scaffolding of expectation and distribution that you don&#39;t damage your chances at the same time you keep overhead low enough to profit even when you <em>don&#39;t</em> make the top 100. Which, given the odds, is more likely than not.</p>\r\n<p>Today, it&#39;s easier than ever to put your work into the world. Easier to have a blog, to share your technology, to sing your songs, to connect, with no middlemen. So, the question is: how much should you give away/pay for the scaffolding that promises to take you over the hump to the other side of the tail?</p>\r\n<p>The magic of the long tail is that it&#39;s open to everyone. The danger in overinvesting in the hype machine and the turboboost of outbound marketing is that it may just distract you from what actually creates viral videos, hit books and freelancers in high demand: genuine excitement from a core group that won&#39;t rest until they tell their friends.</p>\r\n<p>My take is that the benefit for winner-take-most markets is that anything you can do that realistically increases your chances of being the winner is a smart move--<em><strong>unless</strong></em> (double emphasis intended) the cost decreases your opportunity to do it again soon, or the compromises you&#39;re required to make undermine the very excitement you&#39;re trying to create.</p>\r\n<p>No obvious answer, no map. Asking the question is the essential first step in finding a path.</p>",

Read all the details to find the big picture and the link to sign up. Every city needs a volunteer organizer as well, and you can take the lead on the meetup site when you get there.</p>\r\n<p>The short version: people volunteer to give a 140 second talk about what they&#39;re working on, creating or building, to do it with vulnerability, passion and generosity. And then to sit down and cheer on the next person.</p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of cities, thousands of people, all connecting at the same time, around the world.</p>\r\n<p>These are free, self-organized exchanges of bravery. A chance to find fellow travelers, artists and those making a ruckus and hear what they&#39;re passionate about. No pitching, no selling, but a 140-second confession of passion, fear and connection.</p>\r\n<p>To kick it off, I&#39;m hosting a live lecture, reading and session the afternoon of January 2nd in New York City. Details are <a href=\"http://icarusnewyork.eventbrite.com/\" target=\"_self\">right here.</a>&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>I&#39;ll be hosting future events in Boston, London and one or two other cities over the coming months. I&#39;ll announce some soon.</p>\r\n<p>I can promise it&#39;ll be interesting, and it might just change your work.</p>",

Paging through them, I&#39;m thrilled at how they came out, and together, they might represent my best ever effort at communicating the revolution we&#39;re living through. I hope you&#39;ll take the time to give them a read.</p>\r\n<p>Three books at once might be crazy, but with your help, it might turn out to be a great idea. This is about making books for my readers, as opposed to finding readers for my books--and it all depends on whether you choose to read the books and to spread the word.</p>\r\n<p>The first, the core book of the three, is <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591846072?tag=mhsvortex\" target=\"_self\">The Icarus Deception</a></em>. (<a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-icarus-deception-seth-godin/1112575504?ean=9781591846079\" target=\"_self\">BN</a>) (<a href=\"http://800ceoread.com/book/show/9781591846079S-The_Icarus_Deception\" target=\"_self\">5 pack</a>) (<a href=\"http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/Icarus-Deception-Seth-Godin/9781591846079\" target=\"_self\">outside US</a>) It&#39;s about the death of the industrial economy, the need for art and the chance of a lifetime. You can read a <a href=\"http://changethis.com/manifesto/show/100.01.IcarusDeception\" target=\"_self\">free sample</a> here.</p>\r\n<p>(PS 1,000 copies of Icarus are hand-signed, and if you find one with a colored autograph, let me know, as I have a gift for you.)</p>\r\n<p>The second is called&#0160;<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591846102?tag=permissionmarket\" target=\"_self\">V is for Vulnerable</a>, </em>(<a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/v-is-for-vulnerable-seth-godin/1112575499?ean=9781591846109\" target=\"_self\">BN</a>)&#0160;It&#0160;was created with Hugh Macleod, and it takes the last chapter of <em>Icarus</em> and turns it into a 26-spread illustrated book. I&#39;ve been so delighted with the reaction this book has caused among the people who have actually touched it--changing the format turns out to be an effective way to get the message out. And it&#39;s fun.</p>\r\n<p>The third is a big book, a high-value (plenty of pages per dollar!) collection of the best of the last six years of this blog. We named it <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591846099?tag=permissionmarket\" target=\"_self\">Whatcha Gonna Do With That Duck</a></em>. (<a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/whatcha-gonna-do-with-that-duck-seth-godin/1112575498?ean=9781591846093\" target=\"_self\">BN</a>)&#0160;For those of you that didn&#39;t get a chance to get the limited edition <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VpCsmxKx504\" target=\"_self\">behemoth</a>, here&#39;s a smaller, abridged black and white edition that sits right next to <em>Small is the New Big</em>. I&#39;m incredibly proud (and a bit amazed) to experience a volume that took this long to write.</p>\r\n<p>[PS we just added a <a href=\"http://www.800ceoread.com/sethbundle\" target=\"_self\">three-book bundle</a>, all in one click]</p>\r\n<p>Of course, you can wait until January and wait until your friends have copies and wait until it&#39;s already being discussed, but I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll do me a favor and show your favorite bookseller your support and order a copy now before the holiday craziness distracts us all.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, as always, not just for reading, but for doing something important with the ideas. I appreciate your support more than I can say.</p>",

These aren&#39;t for everyone, and they require effort to find, to buy and to maintain, but for those that care about the cutting edge or innovation or style, they&#39;re perfect.</p>\r\n<p>Then, over time, many of these organizations start to make products and services that are carefree. The people who produce them care so much about what they&#39;re making that they get good at it, the design becomes simpler, the pricing becomes better, and more people use it. The result is efficiency and distribution.</p>\r\n<p>Until soon, the product or service is used by people who don&#39;t care so much about the original intent, they just want something easy and functional and available and cheap.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a class=\"asset-img-link\" href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017c31e814a0970b-popup\" onclick=\"window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Mostpeopledontcare\" class=\"asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b31569e2017c31e814a0970b\" src=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017c31e814a0970b-320wi\" title=\"Mostpeopledontcare\" /></a><br />This is the classic diffusion of innovations process. (Learn more about this key concept <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations\" target=\"_self\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0060517123\" target=\"_self\">here</a> <a href=\"http://www.drdouggreen.com/2012/the-diffusion-of-innovation-5th-ed-by-everett-rogers/\" target=\"_self\">and </a><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Are-All-Weird-Seth-Godin/dp/1936719223\" target=\"_self\">here</a>). Those in the mass market <em>choose</em> to be the mass market because they&#39;re too busy or distracted or bored to be the innovators and the geeks. They don&#39;t care enough to be on the edge.</p>\r\n<p>Some examples: ebooks were first sold to just a few people. They were tricky to download, they weren&#39;t cheap and they required more effort. Over time, the price of the reader comes down, more books are available and it becomes more attractive to the mass market.</p>\r\n<p>Or the car transforms from something for millionaires and hobbyists into the Honda Civic. You don&#39;t buy a Civic because you want to do your own tune ups. You just want it to work, and to be inexpensive.</p>\r\n<p>Or the charity that starts out on the bleeding edge of technology, raising speculative money from a few philanthropists, but then moves into the mainstream and becomes an easy cause to explain and support.</p>\r\n<p>Or the musician and his band and his label who goes from hand-crafting music to mass-producing live spectacles.</p>\r\n<p>Apple, of course, is the classic example. The Mac was, for the longest time, only bought by people who cared a lot about which computer they bought. And the iPhone transformed the market because it became a phone for people who wanted to care about their phone.</p>\r\n<p>The recent launch of the iPhone5 disappointed the geeks, but that was on purpose. Apple introduced a phone for their target market, which is people who don&#39;t care as much about the phone as the geeks do. They introduced a phone that worked, not one that was fascinating because it was loaded with untested new features.</p>\r\n<p>But here&#39;s where it gets interesting...</p>\r\n<p>The first step is people who care making a product for people who care.</p>\r\n<p>The second step is people who care making a product for people who don&#39;t care.</p>\r\n<p>And the third step, so difficult to avoid, is that the growing organization starts hiring people, not necessarily people who care, to grow their ever-industrializing company. And since they are servicing customers who don&#39;t care, those employees who don&#39;t care can get away with it (for a while).</p>\r\n<p>Think General Motors, 1986. No one pushed back on the horrid design and build quality of the Cadillac. No, the people who cared all bought a Mercedes instead, and those that didn&#39;t care, didn&#39;t care. Until it was too late.</p>\r\n<p>You&#39;re not going to have hordes of disappointed mass market customers cursing you out about quality or design. They don&#39;t care enough to do that.</p>\r\n<p>It&#39;s totally okay for an organization to have the mission of making a carefree, ubiquitous product or service for people too busy or focused elsewhere. Totally fine to make something that&#39;s popular largely because it&#39;s popular. The danger creeps in when your team listens to their (mass) market and stops caring as well. When that happens, a new company comes along to care again.</p>",

            "content" : "<p>This is a waste for the buyer and the seller.</p>\r\n<p>When you have a business or individual waiting for you to bring them custom work, it can lead to an endless cycle of, &quot;hmmmm not quite right.&quot; If the architectural drawings, high-heeled shoes or ad campaign doesn&#39;t meet their unstated standards, you&#39;re back to doing it again.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes you can make a handsome profit on all the fees you charge to redo things that indulge the ego of the customer, but more likely than not, your time is wasted until they&#39;re happy. If you have a client who feels the same way, you can work together to save time and money by being clear with each other about what&#39;s wanted.</p>\r\n<p>I think helping a client say what they want before they see it is a worthy endeavor.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Do it on purpose. When engaging with a new client, intentionally create an environment where personal taste is described in advance, and as much boundary-building as possible is done when it&#39;s cheap to iterate, not at the end when it&#39;s expensive.</li>\r\n<li>Demand benchmarks. The world is filled with things that are a lot like what you&#39;ve been asked to create. So mutually identify them. Show me three other websites that feel like what you&#39;re hoping to feel like. Hand me a hardcover book that has type that reads the way you want yours to read. Walk me through a building that has the vibe you&#39;re looking for...</li>\r\n<li>Describe the assignment before you start. Using your words and the words of the client, precisely state what problem you&#39;re trying to solve. &quot;We&#39;re trying to build something that does a, b and c, and not d...&quot;</li>\r\n<li>Then, before you show off your proposal, before you hand in your work, restate the problem again. &quot;You asked us to do a, b and c at a cost of under X. What I&#39;m about to show you does a, it does b and it does c... and it costs half of X.&quot; This sort of intentional restatement of the scope of work respects your client by honoring their stated intent, at the same time it focuses your work on the stated goals.</li>\r\n<li>Make a decision about whether you want a reputation for doing this sort of focused work. If you do, don&#39;t work for clients who don&#39;t buy into the process. Over time, you&#39;ll earn the kind of clients you want.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Of course, this isn&#39;t going to work every time. Sometimes the client loves the power of saying no. Sometimes the client isn&#39;t articulate enough to describe what she wants. And sometimes the goal is magic, and no one knows how to describe that in advance.</p>",

We talked about Space Food Sticks and Tang and Gilligan&#39;s Island and the Batmobile for years, even though there certainly wasn&#39;t a lot of depth. Hit movies and books stayed on the bestseller lists for months or even years (!)</p>\r\n<p>Today, an internet video or an investment philosophy or a political moment might last for weeks or even a few days. It&#39;s not unusual for a movie or a book or even a TV series to come and go before most people notice it. Neophilia has fundamentally changed the culture.</p>\r\n<p>The result is that there&#39;s an increasing desire, almost a panic, for something new. Yesterday was a million years ago, and tomorrow is already here. The rush for new continues to increase, and it is now surpassing our ability to satisfy it.</p>\r\n<p>When that need can&#39;t be filled (which is not surprising, if you think about it) then we&#39;re inclined to declare that it&#39;s the end, the end of new ideas, the end of progress, the end of everything that&#39;s interesting. Spend a week or two watching TED videos and once you catch up, you might find yourself saying, &quot;sure, but what&#39;s new <em>now</em>?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>If you&#39;re in the business of making a new thing, this churn may be an opportunity, because it&#39;s easier now than ever to send a hit up the pop charts, whatever sort of pop you make. But it comes at a price, which is that it won&#39;t last, and you&#39;ll quickly have to go back and make another one.</p>\r\n<p>The real opportunity, I think, is in trying to build longer arcs. Now that the cycle of new is eating itself in a race to ever-faster, there&#39;s a bigger chance to make long term change by consistently focusing on what works (and what&#39;s important), not what&#39;s new and merely shiny. </p>\r\n<p>What&#39;s important, what&#39;s always important, is useful change.</p>",

Amazon lets you praise the author of a book that touched you.</p>\r\n<p>But what about the hard-working and insightful organizations we work with to make our businesses succeed? We spend all day with them, and bet our reputations on them, but it&#39;s not often we get to highlight the vendors who bring humanity to their work. It&#39;s so easy to focus on the broken software and the broken promises that take up so much of our time, but it turns out that it&#39;s the miracle workers that actually make our best work possible.</p>\r\n<p>As I finish up my huge Kickstarter project, I wanted to share the names of some of the folks I counted on to make it work:&#0160;</p>\r\n<p>Michael Quinn is a <a href=\"http://www.quinnessentials.com/\" target=\"_self\">print broker</a> who keeps his promises, no matter how complicated the job is.</p>\r\n<p>Hugh Macleod is a <a href=\"http://gapingvoid.com/\" target=\"_self\">genius</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Pirate&#39;s Press is my favorite choice for <a href=\"http://www.piratespress.com/cms/\" target=\"_self\">producing and packaging LPs</a>. They care and it shows.</p>\r\n<p>Alex Miles Younger runs <a href=\"http://unozip.com/\" target=\"_self\">Unozip</a>, a graphic design firm that will both make you look good and help you enjoy the process.</p>\r\n<p>Robyn and the team at Global are a patient and wise <a href=\"http://www.gloful.com/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_self\">fulfillment house</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Dan runs a classic <a href=\"http://www.thearmnyc.com/\" target=\"_self\">letterpress shop</a> in Brooklyn, and does it with generosity and talent. Go take a class and bring your coworkers.</p>\r\n<p>And Brian continues to deliver professional web work with his team at <a href=\"http://viget.com/\" target=\"_self\">Viget</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I&#39;m also delighted to be able to work with caring, insightful people like my copyeditor <a href=\"http://www.the-efa.org/dir/memberinfo.php?mid=4460\" target=\"_self\">Catherine E. Oliver</a>, my agent&#0160;<a href=\"http://larkproductions.com/\" target=\"_self\">Lisa DiMona</a>, librarian <a href=\"http://thestoryoftelling.com/\" target=\"_self\">Bernie Jiwa</a>, artist&#0160;<a href=\"http://lorikoop.com/\" target=\"_self\">Lori Koop</a>, connectrix <a href=\"http://projectexponential.com/\" target=\"_self\">Michelle Welsch</a>, rights guru <a href=\"http://www.teritobias.com/\" target=\"_self\">Teri Tobias</a> and the editorial duo of Adrian Zackheim and Niki Papadopolous.</p>\r\n<p>Every day I&#39;m amazed that I have the privilege of doing the work I do, and I know that I wouldn&#39;t be able to do it without the combined efforts of literally thousands of people who do more than they have to. From the infrastructure that gives us the stability we need to dream to the person who says yes instead of no, I&#39;m grateful. [Don&#39;t forget <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m57gzA2JCcM\" target=\"_self\">Arlo</a>.]</p>\r\n<p>I guess that&#39;s what we all we need. People with a point of view who do more than they have to.</p>\r\n<p>And thanks to you, of course, for reading and for cheering us all on.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you.</p>",
